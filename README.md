# basics

Whenever I start a new project, I find that there is a bit of drudgery
involved in just setting up the basics, things like:

* Creating initial autoconf, automake files
* Parsing command-line options
* Setting up a logging mechanism
* Specifying dependencies for common libraries, e.g. boost

This repository includes starting points for new projects.
